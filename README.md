# MnM's Graph
### Requirements
* Python 3
* Pandas 2
* Numpy 2
* Matplotlib 3
### Uses
The main use of this project is to Demonstright my knowalge of matplotlibbut with minor modifcations the script could be used as a basic 3D barchart template
## MnM's.csv
### Description
MnM's.csv is all the data used by MnM's.py. it sorts a collection of 3 bags of MnM's into color and type.
### Usage
Outside of MnM's.py MnM's.cvs has no use as it is only data
## MnM's.py
### Description
MnM's.py uses all the data gathered in MnM's.csv and uses matplotlib to graph and label all the data on a 3D bar chart.
### Usage
To run MnM's.py simply put bothMnM's.py and MnM's.cvs into your python 3 environment and run the command
```
python3 MnM's.py
```
### Output
your output should look like this. this code was made specifficly for my data so using your own csv file may not work with MnM's.py but editing MnM's.csv with your own data will still graph your data.
