## M&M's.csv
### Description
M&M's.csv is all the data used by M&M's.py. it sorts a collection of 3 bags of M&M's into color and type.
### Usage
Outside of M&M's.py M&M's.cvs has no use as it is only data
## M&M's.py
### Description
M&M's.py uses all the data gathered in M&M's.csv and uses matplotlib to graph and label all the data on a 3D bar chart.
### Usage
To run M&M's.py simply put bothM&M's.py and M&M's.cvs into your python 3 environment and run the command
```bash
python3 M&M's.py
```
### Output
your output should look like this. this code was made specifficly for my data so using your own csv file may not work with M&M's.py but editing M&M's.csv with your own data will still graph your data.
